				<p style="font-size:25px;text-align:center;padding: 0 40px;">The purpose of this website is to broaden
					the knowledge of the users about the Twelve
					Apostles of Jesus Christ. It contains the information and history about their lives and how they
					lived
					with
					Jesus Christ during their eras. This website is created for us to appreciate the history of
					Christianism
					and
					to strengthen the faith in God. There are no websites that create or have created the same content
					that
					this
					website has.</P>
				<p style="font-size:
	50px;text-align:center;"> GETTING TO KNOW ABOUT THE 12 APOSTLES </P>

				<p style="font-size:30px;padding: 0 40px;">
					IT IS an eloquent testimony to the charm and righteousness of Jesus’ earth life that, although he
					repeatedly
					dashed to pieces the hopes of his apostles and tore to shreds their every ambition for personal
					exaltation,
					only one deserted him.
					The apostles learned from Jesus about the kingdom of heaven, and Jesus learned much from them about
					the
					kingdom of men, human nature as it lives on Urantia and on the other evolutionary worlds of time and
					space.
					These twelve men represented many different types of human temperament, and they had not been made
					alike
					by
					schooling. Many of these Galilean fishermen carried heavy strains of gentile blood as a result of
					the
					forcible conversion of the gentile population of Galilee one hundred years previously.
					Do not make the mistake of regarding the apostles as being altogether ignorant and unlearned. All of
					them,
					except the Alpheus twins, were graduates of the synagogue schools, having been thoroughly trained in
					the
					Hebrew scriptures and in much of the current knowledge of that day. Seven were graduates of the
					Capernaum
					synagogue schools, and there were no better Jewish schools in all Galilee.
					When your records refer to these messengers of the kingdom as being “ignorant and unlearned,” it was
					intended to convey the idea that they were laymen, unlearned in the lore of the rabbis and untrained
					in
					the
					methods of rabbinical interpretation of the Scriptures. They were lacking in so-called higher
					education.
					In
					modern times they would certainly be considered uneducated, and in some circles of society even
					uncultured.
					One thing is certain: They had not all been put through the same rigid and stereotyped educational
					curriculum. From adolescence on they had enjoyed separate experiences of learning how to live;</p>

					EACH SAINTS MISSIONS </P>

				<p style="font-size:
		30px;text-align:center;padding: 0 40px;">
					Each Saint Is a Mission. A Christian cannot think of his or her mission on earth without seeing it
					as a
					path
					of holiness, for “this is the will of God, your sanctification” (1 Thessalonians 4:3). Each saint is
					a
					mission, planned by the Father to reflect and embody, at a specific moment in history, a certain
					aspect
					of
					the Gospel. That mission has its fullest meaning in Christ, and can only be understood through him.

					At its core, holiness is experiencing, in union with Christ, the mysteries of his life. It consists
					in
					uniting ourselves to the Lord’s death and resurrection in a unique and personal way, constantly
					dying
					and
					rising anew with him. . . . Every saint is a message which the Holy Spirit takes from the riches of
					Jesus
					Christ and gives to his people.

					To recognize the word that the Lord wishes to speak to us through one of his saints, we do not need
					to
					get
					caught up in details, for there we might also encounter mistakes and failures. Not everything a
					saint
					says
					is completely faithful to the Gospel; not everything he or she does is authentic or perfect. What we
					need to
					contemplate is the totality of their life, their entire journey of growth in holiness, the
					reflection of
					Jesus Christ that emerges when we grasp their overall meaning as a person.

					This is a powerful summons to all of us. You too need to see the entirety of your life as a mission.
					Try
					to
					do so by listening to God in prayer and recognizing the signs that he gives you. Always ask the
					Spirit
					what
					Jesus expects from you at every moment of your life and in every decision you must make, so as to
					discern
					its place in the mission you have received. Allow the Spirit to forge in you the personal mystery
					that
					can
					reflect Jesus Christ in today’s world.

					May you come to realize what that word is, the message of Jesus that God wants to speak to the world
					by
					your
					life. Let yourself be transformed. Let yourself be renewed by the Spirit, so that this can happen,
					lest
					you
					fail in your precious mission. The Lord will bring it to fulfillment despite your mistakes and
					missteps,
					provided that you do not abandon the path of love but remain ever open to his supernatural grace,
					which
					purifies and enlightens </P>
