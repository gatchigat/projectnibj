				<h3 style="text-align: center;font-size: 36px;">Saint Thaddeus</h3>

				<p style="font-size:30px;padding: 0 40px;">
					St. Jude, also called Judas, Thaddaeus, or Lebbaeus, (flourished 1st century CE; Western feast day October 28, Eastern feast days June 19 and August 21), one of the original Twelve Apostles of Jesus. He is the reputed author of the canonical Letter of Jude that warns against the licentious and blasphemous heretics. The devotion to him as patron saint of desperate causes began in France and Germany in the late 18th century.</p>
				<p style="font-size:30px;padding: 0 40px;">
					St. Jude is distinguished in John 14:22 as Judas but “not Iscariot” to avoid identification with the betrayer of Jesus, Judas Iscariot. Indeed, the tradition of calling him “Jude” rather than the Scriptural “Judas” likely started to avoid such confusion. He is listed in Luke 6:16 and Acts 1:13 as “Judas of James,” and, depending on the Bible consulted, he is probably the son (Revised Standard and New English) or brother (Authorized and Douay) of St. James the Less, son of Alphaeus. Jude is more probably identified with Thaddaeus (Lebbaeus) in Mark 3:18 and Matthew 10:3 and less probably with Jesus’ “brother” Judas (Mark 6:3, Matthew 13:55).</p>
				<p style="font-size:30px;padding: 0 40px;">
					According to John 14:22–23, Jude, after Jesus completed the Last Supper and announced his manifestation to his disciples, asks, “Lord, how is it that you will reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?” After Jesus’ Ascension, Jude’s history is unknown. Like St. Simon the Apostle, he seems to have come from the Zealots, the Jewish nationalistic party prior to 70 CE. Legends first appearing in the 4th century credit Simon and Jude with missionary work and martyrdom in Persia (noted in the apocryphal Passion of Simon and Jude). Thus, since the 8th century, the Western church has commemorated them together on October 28. </p>
