				<h3 style="text-align: center;font-size: 36px;">Saint Philip</h3>

				<p style="font-size:30px;padding: 0 40px;">
					According to Christian tradition, Peter was crucified in Rome under Emperor Nero. He is
					traditionally counted as the
					first bishop of Rome‍—‌or pope‍—‌and also by Eastern Christian tradition as the first patriarch of
					Antioch. The ancient
					Christian churches all venerate Peter as a major saint and as the founder of the Church of Antioch
					and the Diocese of
					Rome,[1] but differ in their attitudes regarding the authority of his successors. According to
					Catholic teaching, Jesus
					promised Peter a special position in the Church.[7]</p>
				<p style="font-size:30px;padding: 0 40px;">
					In the New Testament, Peter appears repeatedly and prominently in all four gospels as well as the
					Acts of the Apostles.
					He is the brother of Saint Andrew, and both brothers were fishermen. The Gospel of Mark in
					particular was traditionally
					thought to show the influence of Peter's preaching and eyewitness memories. He is also mentioned,
					under either the name
					Peter or Cephas, in Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians and the Epistle to the Galatians. The New
					Testament also
					includes two general epistles, First Peter and Second Peter, that are traditionally attributed to
					him, but modern
					scholarship generally rejects the Petrine authorship of both.[8] However, there is a growing number
					of scholars that
					have resuscitated the Petrine authorship of the Petrine epistles.</p>
				<p style="font-size:30px;padding: 0 40px;">
					Outside of the New Testament, several apocryphal books were later attributed to him, in particular
					the Acts of Peter,
					Gospel of Peter, Preaching of Peter, Apocalypse of Peter, and Judgment of Peter, although scholars
					believe these works
					to be pseudoepigrapha.</p>
